# Wallpaper-Randomizer
This .ps1 file will switch your wallpaper to a random one you have in a certain path every time you reboot! Good for Lazy people.

# Some info that is important

This program was made because i was kinda bored having to pick between wallpapers so i made a quick and easy .ps1 files that randomly changes your wallpaper everytime you reboot. If you want to switch between more than 1 wallpaper tweak the code in the .ps1 file to have another path I guess. Also if you get kinda lucky and have the same wallpaper 2 or 3 times in a row. do not complain. Computers cant be COMPLETELY random. Any issues please post in the "Issues" tab.

# Some problems that *could* happen. Be careful with formats

Also expect for some formats like .gif, .afif, jfif to maybe not work since it normally uses common formats. Also .mp4 files will NOT work so dont post any issues about video files or Gif files not working.

# How to make it work

Also to use a image replace the path in the .ps1 file and test it by rebooting, Thank you for trying my program :)
